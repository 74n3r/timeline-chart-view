===================

### Description

An android view to represent data over a timeline.

### Demo

[![timeline-chart-view demo video.](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8MhZdYe4I60/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MhZdYe4I60 "timeline-chart-view demo video.")


### Features

* Display a graph with timeline events.
* Use an android cursor to access the data and register an DataSetObserver to detect changes and automatically refresh the view.
* Scrolling sound effects.
* Auto tick label format selection.
* Auto color scheme generation based on the background color, but also support custom user palette.
* Various graphical representation (normal bars, stacked bars and side-by-side bars)


### Integration

The library is avalilable at [jcenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter). You reference inside gradle script with the next snippet of code.

```
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.ruesga.timeline-chart-view:timeline-chart-view:1.0.0'
}
```


### Sample code

You can use it by adding a *com.ruesga.timelinechart.TimelineChartView* tag to an android xml layout. You can customize the view behaviour by defining a namespace (xe: xmlns:tlc="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto") and edit its custom properties (see custom behaviour section for more details).
```xml
<com.ruesga.timelinechart.TimelineChartView
    xmlns:tlc="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/graph"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="320dp"
    android:background="?attr/colorPrimary"
    tlc:tlcGraphBackground="?attr/colorPrimary"
    tlc:tlcFooterBackground="@color/primary_light"
    tlc:tlcShowFooter="true"
    tlc:tlcGraphMode="tlcBarsStack"/>
```

After that, just obtain the reference as any other android view and start observing a cursor which contains the next fields (in this order): a long with the timestamp and one or more doubles values (one for every serie to represent int the graph).
```java
Cursor cursor = ...
TimelineChartView mGraph = (TimelineChartView) findViewById(R.id.graph);
mGraph.observeData(cursor);
```

Check out the *sample* directory for a basic usage of the library.

**That's all.** 



### Custom Behaviour

You can configure the some of the behaviour at xml style or at runtime. In addition of the javadoc description in the source code, this is a extended enumeration of all available behaviour (check the source code and the sample app to obtain a more detail explanation of every property).

**tlcGraphBackground**: Background color of the graph area. This value also determines the autogereated palette of colors, if no user palette was used. **#setGraphAreaBackground(int)** can be used at runtime to set this color.

**tlcFooterBackground**: Background color of the footer area. **#setFooterAreaBackground(int)** can be used at runtime to set this color.

**tlcShowFooter**: A boolean value indicating whether to show/hide the footer of the graph. **#setShowFooter(boolean)** can be used at runtime to show/hide the footer area.

**tlcFooterBarHeight**: A float value indicating the height of footer area of the graph. **#setFooterHeight(float)** can be used at runtime to set the height the footer area.

**tlcBarItemWidth**: A float value indicating the width of a bar item of the graph. **#setBarItemWidth(float)** can be used at runtime to set the width of a bar item.

**tlcBarItemSpace**: A float value indicating the space between bar items. **#setBarItemSpace(float)** can be used at runtime to set the space between bar items.

**tlcGraphMode**: The graph representation mode. This attribute accepts 3 modes: tlcBars (series are draw one over the other), tlcBarsStack (series are draw one on top the other), tlcBarsSideBySide (series are draw one beside the other). **#setGraphMode(int)** can be used at runtime to set the graph mode (see **#GRAPH_MODE_BARS**, **#GRAPH_MODE_BARS_STACK** and **#GRAPH_MODE_BARS_SIDE_BY_SIDE**).

**tlcPlaySelectionSoundEffect**: A boolean value indicating whether play sound effects on item selection. **#setPlaySelectionSoundEffect(boolean)** can be used at runtime to set if the view should reproduce sound effects.

**tlcSelectionSoundEffectSource**: A reference to a raw resource identifier that will be play as sound effect on item selection. Define an invalid resource identifier (value 0) to use the system default sound effect. **#setSelectionSoundEffectSource(int)** can be used at runtime to set the resource to use as sound effect.

**tlcAnimateCursorTransition**: Whether full cursor swap are graphical animated. **#setAnimateCursorTransition(boolean)** can be used at runtime to set.

**tlcFollowCursorPosition**: Whether follow real time cursor updates (live update). Only if scroll is in the last item. **#setFollowCursorPosition(boolean)** can be used at runtime to set the behaviour on cursor updates.

**tlcAlwaysEnsureSelection**: Whether move current view to the nearest selection if, after a user scroll/fling operation, the view is not centered in an item. If **true** move view to the nearest item and selected it. **#setAlwaysEnsureSelection(boolean)** can be used at runtime to set the behaviour when selection requires to be ensured.
